	* Added Bugzilla module
	
	* Changed the name of the "bug" command in the AdminCommands
	plugin to "reportbug" instead.
	
	* Added QUIT stat-keeping to ChannelDB.  This added another column
	to the database; you'll need to add a 'quits' column to both
	user_stats and channel_stats.  Good luck.
	
	* Removed the OwnerCommands.say command; it wasn't useful enough,
	and is so easily written that anyone can have it back if they want
	it.
	
	* Moved bestuptime command from FunDB to Status.
	
	* Changed OwnerCommands.load (and loadPluginModule) to be
	case-insensitive, so "load funcommands" works just as well as
	"load FunCommands".
	
2003-10-12  Jeremy Fincher  <jemfinch@users.sf.net>
	
	* Version 0.73.1!

	* Fixed a bug in Math.{calc,rpn} where certain functions
	("degrees" in particular) that didn't like complex arguments would
	fail on numbers on which they shouldn't.

	* Added an optional "key" argument to ChannelCommands.cycle.

	* Fixed bolding in supybot-wizard.py.
	
	* Fixed handling of the secure flag by ircdb.IrcUser.setAuth;
	previously it didn't prevent someone with an unmatched hostmask
	from identifying.

	* Fixed imports in the DCC plugin.

	* Fixed a bug where the bot would not reply to nick-addressed
	messages on a channel if his nick wasn't entirely lowercased.

	* Fixed the Relay plugin to relay topic changes; an oversight not
	caught earlier because supybot has for a long time managed our
	topics.

	* Fixed a bug in the Services plugin where the bot would ghost
	himself if his nick didn't match in case the nick given.

	* Added the ability for PrivmsgCommandAndRegexp to have regexps
	that are called *after* callbacks.addressed has been called on the
	message -- see ChannelDB.{increase,decrease}Karma for an example.

	* Fixed bug in supybot-wizard.py where plugins without configure
	functions would raise an uncaught exception.

	* Fixed debincoming to work since the removal of baseplugin; it
	was missing an import.

	* Fixed MiscCommands.doPrivmsg to send an IrcObjectProxyRegexp to
	the replyWhenNotCommand function.

	* Fixed debversion to display the correct output when no matching
	packages were found.

	* Fixed ChannelDB to import conf; karma didn't work otherwise.

	* Fixed a bug in the Enforcer plugin that would cause the bot to
	ban everyone from the channel whenever ChanServ deopped someone.

	* Changed the "whois" command in the Network plugin to "internic"
	instead.

2003-10-05  Jeremy Fincher  <jemfinch@users.sf.net>

	* Version 0.73.0!

	* Added the News plugin, news handling for channels.
	
	* Changed the initial character of anti capabilities to '-'
	instead of '!'.  '!' can be the initial character in a channel
	name, and so any command using getChannel and accepting a
	capability as its first argument (several in ChannelCommands) will
	have difficulties (the channel then *must* be specified since
	getChannel will consider !capability to be a channel name).  Note
	that this means you'll need to either remove and re-create or edit
	your config files to change ! to - in capabilities.

	* Removed the "cvsup" command; it's been useless since we had a
	global install, and can only serve to confuse.

	* Added a "private" command to MiscCommands to allow users to
	specify that a response should be made in private.

	* Added a "secure" flag to user database records that *requires*
	that one of the user's hostmasks match if the user is to be
	recognized.  This flag may be set with the "setsecure" command.

	* Added a convert command to the Math plugin.  More conversions
	are necessary, if anyone's interested in doing it.  The available
	units are available via the "units" command.

	* Fixed the pydoc command to allow access to standard Python
	modules that are shared libraries rather than pure Python code.

	* Added a "Python" plugin and moved FunCommands.{pydoc,zen} to
	it.

	* Fixed the supybot- scripts to use optparse so they now
	accept many command line options (but most importantly, the --help
	option :))

	* Added a debincoming command to the Debian plugin; it searches
	the available packages at http://incoming.debian.org/

	* Moved the "bug" command from MiscCommands to AdminCommands in 
	order to prevent possible abuse.

	* Changed ChannelDB.seen to default to using nicks; a --user 
	option can be passed to use the old behavior.  Note that this
	means you'll have to update your ChannelDB database; use this
	SQL statement to do so:
	    CREATE TABLE nick_seen (
	    name TEXT UNIQUE ON CONFLICT REPLACE,
	    last_seen TIMESTAMP,
	    last_msg TEXT
	    );
