37597bf Create a commands.process function which runs a function inside a separate process. This is the only way to limit the execution time of a possibly long-running python statement. Use this on String.re, due to the possibility of pathologically long re matching in python. This allows us to remove the 'trusted-only' restriction on string.re. In the future, this should probably be used in other places that take user-supplied regexps, such as 'misc last --regexp', for example, as well as other potentially long-running tasks that can block the bot.

6230a32 Fix setup.py version import. It failed on clean install, since module supybot is not yet available. When importing 'from src', that pulled src/__init__.py, which in turn tried to import the supybot module. Now we edit sys.path and import the .py file directly.

1b84e20 Format.replace: replacement text is now allowed to be the empty string.
0c30016 Create a commands.process function which runs a function inside a separate process. This is the only way to limit the execution time of a possibly long-running python statement. Use this on String.re, due to the possibility of pathologically long re matching in python. This allows us to remove the 'trusted-only' restriction on string.re. In the future, this should probably be used in other places that take user-supplied regexps, such as 'misc last --regexp', for example, as well as other potentially long-running tasks that can block the bot.

d98de45 After talking to jemfinch today, this is the first checkin.  All comments         from the @tracker 1012031 were addressed. The old style __author__ field was used and no __contributors__         (like myself) were added since I don't think the new system is         checked in to CVS yet. I wanted to write a test suite as well but I didn't get to it today.

8610646 Accepted Grantbow's suggestion.
70a9fdb Accepted Grantbow's suggestion.

0349d11 Hopefully, this will fix the unicode issues we have with Amazon

36d9b07 Rename ban/unban back to permban/unpermban and add the mode -b part to unpermban.  I'll leave the addition of mode +b in permban to jemfinch since he'll probably factor out a bit of common code in permban and the new ban command.

ae8af84 RootWarner is a ChannelPluginTestCase and should use assertSnarf* asserts
df5c1b4 Testing security

We'll still keep duplicate entries in the db because it affects randomness.

889e99c Fixed an invalid irc.error in the part command.
2ddb080 * added assertActionRegexp (semi-tested, not thoroughly tested)
a63ee1e * Decided to ditch the "_is_" syntax.  I never liked it and implementing it   may prove to be difficult here.  It may find its way back in, but there's no   point in having it in there now when it doesn't work right anyway.
aee5c6c * Finished up MoobotFactoids, I think.  Added delete, augmentFactoids (foo is   also bar), and replaceFactoids (no foo is bar), as well as cleaning up some   of the regexps that were there (we allow spaces in the factoids, dummy!), and   also made the addFactoids regexp more accomodating to other phrases with the   word "is" in them :)  Also, updated the tests for it, of course.
ea024de * Fixed some quoting issues in list*.  Adopted the practice of repr()'ing all   factoid keys before displaying them (idea stolen from searchfactoids in   Factoids).  Also fixed them in the tests as well as adding a test to insure   that it's done right. * Added the listkeys and listvalues commands.

Locked_by was   redundant if we're only going to let factoid creators lock/unlock.  Removed   it.
