Description: A robust and user friendly Python IRC bot.
 Supybot is a robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy
 to configure) and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely*
 easy to write) Python IRC bot.  It aims to be an adequate
 replacement for most existing IRC bots.  It includes a very
 flexible and powerful ACL system for controlling access to
 commands, as well as more than 50 builtin plugins providing
 around 400 actual commands.
