EVERYONE:
---------
Read LICENSE.  It's a 2-clause BSD license, but you should read it anyway.


USERS:
------
If you're upgrading, read RELNOTES.  If you're new to Supybot, 
read docs/GETTING_STARTED for an introduction to the bot, and read
docs/CAPABILITIES to see how to use capabilities to your greater
benefit. 

If you have any trouble, feel free to swing by #supybot on
irc.freenode.net or irc.oftc.net (we have a Supybot there relaying,
so either network works) and ask questions.  We'll be happy to help
wherever we can.  And by all means, if you find anything hard to
understand or think you know of a better way to do something,
*please* post it on Sourceforge.net so we can improve the bot!

WINDOWS USERS:
--------------
The wizards (supybot-wizard, supybot-newplugin, and
supybot-adduser) are all installed to your Python directory's
\Scripts.  What that *probably* means is that you'll run them like
this: C:\Python23\python C:\Python23\Scripts\supybot-wizard


DEVELOPERS:
-----------
Read OVERVIEW to see what the modules are used for.  Read PLUGIN-EXAMPLE
to see some examples of callbacks and commands written for the bot.
Read INTERFACES to see what kinds of objects you'll be dealing with.
Read STYLE if you wish to contribute; all contributed code must meet
the guidelines set forth there.

Be sure to run "test/test.py --help" to see what options are available
to you when testing.  Windows users in particular should be sure to
exclude test_Debian.py and test_Unix.py.
