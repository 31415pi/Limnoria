EVERYONE:
---------
Read LICENSE.  It's a 2-clause BSD license, but you should read it anyway.


PROGRAMMERS:
------------
Read OVERVIEW to see what the modules are used for.  Read EXAMPLE to see some
examples of callbacks and command written for the bot.  Read STYLE if you ever
wish to contribute.

All contributions need to assign the copyright to Jeremiah Fincher for
licensing and modification purposes.  I'll probably change the modules to fit
STYLE if they don't already fit.  (Of course, that doesn't mean 'all
modifications'; only if you want your code to be included in the *standard
distribution* of Supybot do you need to assign to me the copyright.  If you
don't mind distributing your modifications or additions elsewhere, by all means
keep the copyright.)

Use PyChecker.  Believe me, it makes things better.
