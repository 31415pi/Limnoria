EVERYONE:
---------
Read LICENSE.  It's a 2-clause BSD license, but you should read it anyway.


DEVELOPERS:
------------
Read OVERVIEW to see what the modules are used for.  Read EXAMPLE to see some
examples of callbacks and command written for the bot.  Read STYLE if you ever
wish to contribute.

Use PyChecker.  Believe me, it makes things better.  A sample
.pycheckrc file is included as tools/pycheckrc.  Copy this to your
~/.pycheckrc and you'll be able to check your code with the same
stringent guidelines I've found useful to check my code.


USERS:
------
All commands should be run from the root directory, never from any
subdirectory such as conf/, log/, src/, or plugins/.

All you have to do to get a working bot is run scripts/setup.py and
answer the questions!
