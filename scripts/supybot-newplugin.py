    Supybot offers two major types of plugins: command-based and
    regexp-based.  Command-based plugins are the kind of plugins
    you've seen most when you've used supybot.  They're also the
    most featureful and easiest to write.  Commands can be nested, 
    for instance, whereas regexp-based callbacks can't do nesting.
    
    That doesn't mean that you'll never want regexp-based callbacks.
    They offer a flexibility that command-based callbacks don't offer;
    however, they don't tie into the whole system as well.
    
    If you need to combine a command-based callback with some
    regexp-based methods, you can do so by subclassing
    callbacks.PrivmsgCommandAndRegexp and then adding a class-level
    attribute "regexps" that is a sets.Set of methods that are
    regexp-based.  But you'll have to do that yourself after this
    wizard is finished :)
