    A class-level dictionary 'periodicFiles' maps names of files to
    three-tuples of
    (url, seconds between downloads, function to run with downloaded file).

    'url' should be in some form that urllib2.urlopen can handle (do note that
    urllib2.urlopen handles file:// links perfectly well.)

    'seconds between downloads' is the number of seconds between downloads,
    obviously.  An important point to remember, however, is that it is only
    engaged when a command is run.  I.e., if you say you want the file
    downloaded every day, but no commands that use it are run in a week, the
    next time such a command is run, it'll be using a week-old file.  If you
    don't want such behavior, you'll have to give an error mess age to the user
    and tell him to call you back in the morning.

    'function to run with downloaded file' is a function that will be passed
    a string *filename* of the downloaded file.  This will be some random
    filename probably generated via some mktemp-type-thing.  You can do what
    you want with this; you may want to build a database, take some stats,
    or simply rename the file.  You can pass None as your function and the
    file with automatically be renamed to match the filename you have it listed
    under.  It'll be in conf.dataDir, of course.

    Aside from that dictionary, simply use self.getFile(filename) in any method
    that makes use of a periodically downloaded file, and you'll be set.
