	* Implemented the FreeBSD module for searching ports.
	* Implemented the Unix module for *nix-specific stuff.
	* Implemented a few more commands for the Http module.
	* Changed names of modules to follow a standard convention.
	* Implemented @morehelp system.
	* Gave modules a .public attribute to determine if they should
	  be in @list.
	* Made threaded callbacks nestable :)
	* Removed 'commands' attribute/complication from irclib.Irc.

2002-Sep-03 Jeremy Fincher <jemfinch@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.60.0
	* Fixed TONS and TONS and TONS of bugs.
	* Included sample.conf, to show what a config file should look like.
	* Data for supybot/data has been separated out into its own package to
	decrease upload/download times.
	* A new Anagrams module has been added, as has a new Notes module.
	* All classes are new-style classes now.
	* I wrote a new reload function that both works more efficiently (no
	need to keep a cache of old objects anymore), more consistently (I can
	use new-style classes now), and in less code (it's much simpler the way
	it works).  This is a big gain.
	* I've written the beginnings of a ChannelStats class that handles the
	"seen" command, and later will collect information about different
	messages (how many JOINs, TOPICs, QUITs, etc.) and different stats like
	how many characters, words, messages sent to a channel in toto.
	* COMMAND NESTING R0X0RS!!!
	* Improved the telnet REPL slightly, a better login, printing, etc.
	* Improved the command-line version of the bot.
	* Added several new commands: xor, cfactive, version, crypt,
	timecommand, last, nslookup,

2002-Aug-27 Jeremy Fincher <jemfinch@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.5 -- We're at least halfway to 1.0 :)
	* Again, fixed TONS AND TONS AND TONS of bugs.
	* callbacks.Privmsg.reply is no longer implemented via an exception;
	subclasses can now self.reply more than once.
	* Minor API change in callbacks.Privmsg.getArgs; getArgsLastOptional
	has been removed in favor of the more-flexible optional keyword arg to
	getArgs.
	* Added several commands: exec, (un)setdefaultcapability, (un)settrace,
	calc (in FunCommands)
	* Added cdb library for constant databases that'll be independent of
	platform.
	* Added an asyncore-based interpreter via a socket that lets you telnet
	into the bot and execute code in the bot process.  Very useful for when
	I break things and need to reload but can't talk to the bot anymore :)
	* plugins.Forums is *really* useful :)
	* plugins.Http is getting useful :)
	* TONS of bugs fixed!
	* callbacks.Privmsg now has a "threaded" attribute that you can set if
	you want your subclass to spawn a new thread for every command.

2002-Aug-21 Jeremy Fincher <jemfinch@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.37.0 -- enough bugs to warrant a new minor release :)
	* Fixed ***TONS*** of bugs.
	* Added LICENSE to the top of all .py files written by me.
	* Added plugins/parter.py, which automatically parts a channel on JOIN.
	Useful for networks where, to determine who's a bot, they send everyone
	to a channel such as #botsmustgo and akill those who don't leave.
	* Added plugins/http.py, which hasn't been tested because I don't have
	threads on this Python install.
	* Made FunCommands.port work in reverse, too.  That's why the size of
	this tarball is significantly increased.
	* Added plugins/moobot.py, a duplication of some of the functionality
	of moobot, another bot written in Python.
	* Made ircutils.nick class, to support irc-case-insensitive comparison
	of nicks (and hashing) automatically.
	* Added unit testing framework for classes subclassing
	callbacks.Privmsg.

2002-Aug-07 Jeremy Fincher <jemfinch@user.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.36.3 (this header forgotten in the real release)
	* Ok, fine.  I'm using List Comprehensions now.  Happy?
	* Changed conf.makeClass to use imp instead of exec.
	* Changed traceback logging over to a modified text form of cgitb.
	* Added "find" to FactoidsCommands.
	* Added "capabilities" and "auth" and "unauth" to UserCommands.
	* Lots of little bugfixes.


2002-Jul-31 Jeremy Fincher <jemfinch@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.36.2
	* A whole lotta bug fixes, in general.
	* Fixed bug in FunCommands.timefun.
	* Added 'reconfig' command to OwnerCommands, to configuration changes
	can be enacted without restarting the bot.
	* Added 'protected' to the default turned-off capabilities in an
	IrcChannel.
	* Fixed callbacks.ChannelEnforcer so it wouldn't enforce MODES against
	the sender of the MODE itself).
	* Fixed username to make it lookup the hostmask of a nick given to it.
	* Fixed bug in sections command, and moved it to privmsgs.UserCommands
	since it's referenced by OwnerCommands.unload.
	* Fixed what I hope is the LAST bug in the help command.
	* Added users/channels default arguments to ircdb.checkIgnored and
	ircdb.checkCapability so they don't *have* to rely on global state.
	* Added CTCP SOURCE command.


2002-Jul-31 Jeremy Fincher <jemfinch@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.36.
	* Added makeFactoids.py and dumpFactoids.py to the tools/ subdirectory
	to facilitate the transfer of the bot from one Python installation to
	another.
	* Added Logger, a per-channel logger that logs rather similar to mIRC's
	channel format.
	* Fixed bug in RawLogger -- it was filtering away all messages from
	ever being sent to the network.
	* Added a factoids plugin.
	* Added __eq__ and __hash__ methods to ircmsgs.IrcMsg so it can be
	compared for equality and used in hash tables.  As a side note, I also
	changed .args to be a tuple rather than a list.
	* Added 'sections' command to FunCommands, to see what Privmsg-derived
	classes are hanging about in the bot.
	* Added 'unload' command to OwnerCommands, to remove a callback in a
	running Irc instance.
	* Added 'load' command to OwnerCommands, allowing owners to dynamically
	load a module that wasn't previously loaded and insert it into a
	running Irc instance.
	* Made UserCommands.addhostmask require that the hostmask not already
	be an identifier for any other user.
	* Fixed bug in help command (again :))


2002-Jul-30 Jeremy Fincher <tweedgeezer@hotmail.com>

	* Version 0.35.
	* Started moving some stuff out to the plugins/ subdirectory.  Haven't
	yet developed an adequate interface for plugin modules, though -- I'm
	not entirely sure that it's needed.
	* Began writing tests.  At least I know the format of the test *data*,
	I just haven't quite developed the framework in which to execute it :)
	* Wrote ctcp.Ctcp, an example of PrivmsgRegexp use and a module to
	respond to CTCP commands.
	* Changed callbacks.PrivmsgRegexp to be much easier to use.
	* Fixed bug in ircdb -- channels needed to have a !op capability by
	default, otherwise everyone can do anything requiring op capabilities.
	Found several of these type of bugs; had to revert to the old config
	style (using a dictionary for capabilities instead of a list) in order
	to resolve them.
	* Generalized exception propogation mechanism so any exception in
	conf.deadlyExceptions would be propogated, not just asyncore.ExitNow.
	* Added command-line parsing and the ability to specify a configuration
	file as an option.
	* Added ircmsgs.IrcMsg.__len__, so calculating the (probable) length of
	an IRC message doesn't require making a string of it first.
	* Added code to make the Irc object ping the server every
	conf.pingInterval seconds.  I've always found that having the bot ping
	the server leads to a more robust bot (easier detection of bad network
	or a dropped connection).
	* Made AsyncoreDriver capable of reconnecting.
	* Moved AsynchatDriver to asyncoreDrivers.py, renamed some things, and
	redesigned it so there's always an asyncore polling driver and the
	individual asyncore drivers don't poll.  The code is much simpler and
	clearer this way.
	* Fixed bug in ircutils.separateModes (tried to pop arguments on modes
	that didn't take an argument.)
	* Renamed the "unixstats" command in FunCommands to "progstats".
	* Fixed bug in callbacks.Privmsg.help.
	* Removed ircdb.checkPrivmsgCapability.


2002-Jul-29 Jeremy Fincher <tweedgeezer@hotmail.com>

	* Version 0.34.
	* Changed FunCommands.cputime to FunCommands.cpustats.
	* Moved bot.upkeep to world.upkeep (superReload can't reload __main__,
	so having it in world allows it to be reloaded.)
	* Added timestamp to debug message printing in irclib.
	* Changed IrcMsg .{nick,user,host} to simple attributes.
	* Added OwnerCommands.{set, unset} to set and unset temporary runtime
	variables.  As an example of their use, look at bot.upkeep.
	* Added conf.timestampFormat, so timestamps can be universally of the
	same form.
	* Added FunCommands.netstats.
	* Added callbacks.RootWarner, to warn people when they join a channel
	as root.
	* Added callbacks.ChannelEnforcer, to enforce certain capabilities on
	channel.
        * added ircdb.checkCapabilties and ircdb.checkPrivmsgCapabilities,
	which check for any capability in a list of capabilities.
	* added privmsgs.ChannelCommands.{voice,halfop}
	* added ircdb.IrcChannel.checkBan
	* Fixed bug in IrcUser.__init__


2002-Jul-27 Jeremy Fincher <tweedgeezer@hotmail.com>

	* Version 0.33 (third release).
	* Bot now exits cleanly on @quit.
	* Renamed former 'irccontrol' module to the much more appropriate name
	'ircdb', which is also much easier to type and read.
	* Changed slightly the config format for conf/users and conf/channels.
	* Added a new command in ChannelCommands, 'setdefaultcapability', to
	set the default capability response for a channel.
	* Rewrote ircdb.checkCapability because the old version was buggy.
	Hopefully this one isn't.
	* Added callbacks.Privmsg.reply and .error, to make things a bit in
	client code.  Major caveat, though: you can't blindly "except:" any
	longer.  You *must* stick a "except self.reserved: raise" in there.
	"except Exception, e:" should still work, since the classes raised
	don't inherit from Exception.
