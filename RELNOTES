Version 0.75.0

Don't forget to reinstall (i.e., run "python setup.py install" as
root).

You will need to re-run supybot-wizard and generate a new botscript.

The Infobot plugin has been removed from this release; it's not ready
for prime time.  If you're interested in getting it running (i.e., you
want full Infobot compatibility and aren't satisfied with either
MoobotFactoids or Factoids) then swing over to #supybot and we can
discuss the tests.  We simply don't know enough about Infobot to make
sure our Infobot plugin is an exact replica, and need someone's help
with making the changes necessary for that.
