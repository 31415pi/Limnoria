No, really.  Darcs is way cooler and the Darcs repository has all the new
code (like our new supybot-newplugin and supybot-test).

"darcs get http://source.supybot.com/supybot/" for the new Supybot code.
"darcs get http://source.supybot.com/supybot-plugins/" for plugins that aren't
included in the official Supybot.

You can get Darcs at http://darcs.net/
