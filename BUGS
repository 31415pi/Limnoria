I'm sure there are tons of them.  When you find them, send them to us and we'll
fix them ASAP.  I'd love to have a bugless bot someday...

(BTW, the way to "send the bugs to us" is via SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=489447&group_id=58965&func=browse)

Known bugs that probably won't get fixed:

Sometimes something bolded is split between chunks (the chunks you use @more
to read).  This throws off the bolding of the "(2 more messages)" part, and
the bolding is lost when the next message starts.  This would involve way too
much work to be fixed.
