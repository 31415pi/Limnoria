We're sure there are tons of them.  When you find them, send them to us and
we'll fix them ASAP.  We'd love to have a bugless bot someday...

Incidentally, the way to "send the bugs to us" is via SourceForge:
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=489447&group_id=58965&func=browse>

Known bugs that probably won't get fixed:

BadWords' outFilter filters colors.  It's not a high priority to get
that fixed.
