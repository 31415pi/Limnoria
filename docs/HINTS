There are just little tidbits that you might need/want to know.

In order to make a module dynamically loadable, all you gotta do 
is have a callback named "Class" and throw it in plugins/ .

In order to begin writing a callback, you'll want to run
scripts/newplugin.

Everything you run needs to be run from the root supybot directory;
don't ever run anything from *inside* src/ or plugins/ or scripts/ or
test/.
