So here's a general *programming* introduction to what the different
modules do and what services they provide.  It is, however, only an
introduction.  Read the modules themselves for a much more detailed
explanation :)

fix.py: Stuff that Python should (but doesn't) include by default.

cdb.py: A constant database library, translated from C (and my O'Caml
        version) More information available at
        http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html.  Not currently used since we
        switched to PySQLite.

ansi.py: Contains different ANSI color sequences.
         Mostly used by the debug module.

conf.py: The configuration file for the bot -- it sets a lot of
         variables that other modules check for when they have
         questions about what they need to do.

world.py: Just a dropping off place for some globals that need to be
          shared among all the modules.  It's obviously not used *a
          lot*, but some things seem to fit better here than anywhere
          else.

template.py: A template used by setup.py to create customized runnable
             Python scripts for individual bots.

privmsgs.py: Basic stuff relating to callbacks.Privmsg, the base class
             for most plugins.

callbacks.py: A few basic callbacks providing significant
              functionality.  You'll likely be inheriting from Privmsg
              quite a bit.

ircdb.py: The users and channels databases are here, as well as the
          IrcUser and IrcChannel classes.  Look here when you want to
          restrict a command to only certain users.

irclib.py: Provides the most important class in the irclib, Irc.  It
           represents a connection to an IRC server, but it's entirely
           separate from the network implementation.  It's connected
           to the network (or whatever else drives it) by a "driver"
           module which uses its feedMsg/takeMsg functions.

drivers.py: The baseclass (IrcDriver) for various drivers to drive
            irclib.Irc classes.  Also, the driving mechanism.

asyncoreDrivers.py: The asyncore-based drivers for use with the bot.

socketDrivers.py: The plain old socket-based drivers for use with the
                  bot.

twistedDrivers.py: The Twisted <http://www.twistedmatrix.com/> drivers
                   for use with the bot.

ircmsgs.py: The IrcMsg class (get to know it :)) and various functions
            for making the creation of IrcMsgs easier.

ircutils.py: Various utility functions for Irc -- read the module to
             see what goodies are there :)

schedule.py: A schedule driver (which is automatically registered with
             the drivers module) to run things at a particular time,
             or at specified periods of time.
