Ok, so you've decided to try out Supybot.  That's great!  The more people who
use Supybot, the more people can submit bugs and help us to make it the best
IRC bot in the world :)

So what do you do?  First thing you'll want to do is run (with root
privileges) "python setup.py install".  This will install Supybot globally.
### TODO: Local installs.
### TODO: Explain how to run tests?

After that, you'll want to run supybot-wizard and generate yourself a 
configuration file.  To run this configuration file, you'll want to type 
"supybot <config file>", replacing <config file> with the name of the
configuration file you just generated with the supybot-wizard.  The supybot
program accepts several command-line parameters which you can see by simply
running "supybot --help"

After that, you should have a bot up and running in the 

# TODO: Identification, owner, etc.

# Common problems
#   import error in http (relies on python-xml)
#   import error in database-based plugins.
#   Can't find the wizard.  Full path on Windows and MacOS X.
