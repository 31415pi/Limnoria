Ok, so you've decided to try out Supybot.  That's great!  The more
people who use Supybot, the more people can submit bugs and help us to
make it the best IRC bot in the world :)

First things first: Supybot *requires* Python 2.3.  There ain't no
getting around it.  If you're a Python developer, you probably know
how superior 2.3 is to previous incarnations.  If you're not, just
think about the difference between a bowl of plain vanilla ice cream
and a banana split.  Or something like that.  Either way, *We're*
Python developers and we like banana splits.

So what do you do?  First thing you'll want to do is run (with
root/admin privileges) "python setup.py install".  This will install
Supybot globally.  If you need to install locally for whatever
reason, see the addendum near the end of this document. 
### TODO: Local installs.
### TODO: Explain how to run tests?

After that, you'll want to run supybot-wizard and generate yourself a 
configuration file.  To run this configuration file, you'll want to type 
"supybot <config file>", replacing <config file> with the name of the
configuration file you just generated with the supybot-wizard.  The supybot
program accepts several command-line parameters which you can see by simply
running "supybot --help"

After that, you should have a bot up and running in the 

# TODO: Identification, owner, etc.

# Common problems
#   import error in http (relies on python-xml)
#   import error in database-based plugins.
#   Can't find the wizard.  Full path on Windows and MacOS X.
