Maximum line length is 79 characters.

Identation is 4 spaces per level.  No tabs.

Single quotes are used for all string literals that aren't docstrings.
They're just easier to type.

Triple double quotes (""") are always used for docstrings, except for the
docstrings on callbacks deriving from callbacks.Privmsg, which use just
double quotes (").

Spaces go around all operators (except around '=' in default arguments to
functions) and after all commas (unless doing so keeps a line within the 79
character limit).

Class names are StudlyCaps.  Method and function names are camelCaps
(StudlyCaps with an initial lowercase letter).  If variable and attribute
names can maintain readability without being camelCaps, then they should be
entirely in lowercase, otherwise they should also use camelCaps.

Imports should always happen at the top of the module, one import per line
(so if imports need to be added or removed later, it can be done easily).

A blank line should be between all consecutive method declarations in a
class definition.  Two blank lines should be between all consecutive class
definitions in a file.  Comments are even better than blank lines for
separating classes.

Code should pass PyChecker with no warnings.

Read PEP 8 (Guido's Style Guide) and know that we use almost all the same style
guidelines.
