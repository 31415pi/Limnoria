Roughly in order of precedence (the closer to the front of the file,
the more likely it'll be done before next release):

* We should have a channel-global value in ircdb.IrcChannel for
  ignoring unregistered users.

* We need to note when bans expire on a channel and send the unban,
  that way plugins can use the ircdb ban stuff and not worry about
  sending or scheduling unbans.

* We should probably add a "hello" command to make things more
  compatible with Eggdrop, since we've been replacing many eggdrop
  bots lately.

* We should be able to set the log level for plugins individually.

* Rbot has a "remind" plugin that seems pretty cool, we should get
  one as well.  It might do well as a command in the Later plugin.

* MozBot has a "list" plugin that seems pretty cool, we should get
  one as well.

Problems that involve a lot of tedious minutiae, but really need to
be done at some point:

Hard problems that won't get done until someone really wants to have
some fun:

* Redundant relaying -- having more than one bot handle relaying,
  where a secondary one will automatically take over if the first
  becomes incapacitated.

* Have the bot detect when other bots are in the channel responding
  to the same prefix character, and do something based on that.

* Unicode support.  Basically, we'd have to have a way to set the
  encoding for the server, and use unicode throughout internally.
  The real issue is how much it would affect the current code to
  switch it over to unicode, and what kind of burden it would put on
  plugin authors to deal with that issue.
